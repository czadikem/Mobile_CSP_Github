Anyone can contribute, you don't have to be a programmer to help make Program-Y and Y-Bot the best chat bot there is, you can

  * Help maintain the core engine. There are still loads of features that can be added to the core engine, plus there is always ways of making him faster and faster
  * Build extensions. Currently, there are a small number of extensions to access things like weather and news feeds, but the possibilities are endless
  * Build Domain Specific Extensions. I've added extensions for Energy, Finance and Telecoms industries. These need adding to, and also more industries to open up the availability of Programy-Y 
  * Create new Grammars. The more we add, the more intelligent the bot becomes
  * Documentation. You are reading this, so you know I'm not the greatest wordsmith. Any help creating documentation would be gratefully received.
  * Testers. Help us test grammars, create test cases and grammar checkers.
