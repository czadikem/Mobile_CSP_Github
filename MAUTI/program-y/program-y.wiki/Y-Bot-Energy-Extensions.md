# Overview
Y-Bot was built on top of the work I did at an Energy company, base on a conversion of Python 2 AIML 1.0 engine to Python 3. Having spent over 5 years working in that industry I have a good knowledge of the types of questions a chatbot can answer, and this is reflected in the depth of the Energy extension.
