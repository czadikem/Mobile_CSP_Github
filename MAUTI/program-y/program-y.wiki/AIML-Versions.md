AIML has been around since 2008 and is currently at version 2.0, however along with the attempt at a standard, Pandorabots, the company formed by Dr Richard Wallace, the inventor of AIML has used extensions to the core language and these are available within Pandorabots ecosystem.

In addition to Pandorabots additions Program-Y also ships with a number of additional tags, some of which are undocumented by PandoraBots or have beed added by myself to make Program-Y bot development easier
