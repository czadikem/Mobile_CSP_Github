# Translation

Programy now uses a combination of the TextBlob translate API and its connectivity with Google translate to allow you
to translate to and from any langauge support by Google Translate

This allows you to continue to use the core Y-Bot, Alice2, Rosie or other bots developed in English, but operate in langauge of choice

To use this feature your bot will need to have internet access to Google so would not work in a closed environment.
