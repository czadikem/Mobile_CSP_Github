AIML can be quite daunting when you start, AIML 2.0 introduced a significant number of new features, and Program-Y adds several more of its own. Suffice to say that there is an infinite number of ways for a grammar to play out.

In addition, Program-Y is in active development, but is open source and therefore comes with the usual caveats with regards to its ongoing development. 

However, we try and respond as quickly as possible to all questions, issues and problems you may be having with the program, a specific bot or just AIML in general. To help speed our response times up and get your a resolution as quick as possible, there are a number of pre-requisites it would be good for you to check, and some supporting information to provide along with your submission to help us answer
