# Installing Program-Y

Program-Y has been designed from the start to be cross-platform and can be developed and executed on a wide range of platforms, including OSX, Linux and Windows. In addition, there are also specific instructions on how to get Program-Y running on Amazon Web Services lightweight web container, Lightsail.

There are numerous ways to install Programy and the associated bots. This has hopefully become easier over time with the introduction of the admin tool. However there are 2 primary methods for each platform

  * **Pip**. This is the most common and easiest way to install Programy today and should be used for those wanting to get a bot up and running but don't need to develop on the core Programy code base
  * **Git**. For those wishing to get to know the internals of Programy, and develop against the core code base, then cloning directly from Git is the preferred option
